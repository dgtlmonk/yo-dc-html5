> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-dc-html5 from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-dc-html5
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo dc-html5
```

### Purpose

The purpose is to scaffold workflow for creating html5 creative. I name the app DoubleClick HTML5 Creative Ad Generator.


### Why use a Generator?

- With different types of html5 creative, it is sometimes tedious to look for working example files on DoubleClick Studio; the process is not only redundant but also time consuming because you have to download the files from DC template database; in worst case scenario re-write the same code over and over again. What if you can generate these HTML5 creatives boilerplate on-the-fly in less than a minute? anywhere? anytime? without internet (after installation of course :P )? 


### Benefits

- Automated process of creating html, javascript and css for any kind of HTML5 creative (scaffold)
- Saves time in creating generic HTML5 Ad for testing or learning purpose. 
- Code structure/convention best practices
- (there is probably more benefits to this generator ... )

### Target User(s)

- Anyone who troubleshoots HTML5 creative and needs a clean working boilerplate of the same creative type to isolate or replicate issue(s) in the nick of time without a hassle.
- Anyone who wants to study building DoubleClick HTML5 Ads by example code.
- Anyone who wants to send a generic working HTML5 creative accordingly.


Notes:
- Templates will be derived from DC Template Database making sure the generated codes comply with DC Studio standards.
- This idea does not intend to replace DoubleClick Template Database page; but this does serve for specific purpose(s) listed in the *Benefits section.
